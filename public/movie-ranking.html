<h2>My top 3 movies in 2023.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Bohemian Rhapsody 2018</h3>
<p>Its more of a documentary on the life of my favourite band Queen!</p>
<h3>Rocketman 2019</h3>
<p>A different approach to documentary with a spice of musical on the life of Elton John (we share the same birthday).</p>
<h3>Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan 2006</h3>
<p>This movie challenges the boundaries of Comedy and I love it.</p>
